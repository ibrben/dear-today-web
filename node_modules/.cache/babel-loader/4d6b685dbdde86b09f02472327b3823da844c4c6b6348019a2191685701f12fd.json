My family are farmers — we grow rice, fruits, vegetables, and raise animals\n                mostly for our own living. Life was simple, and nature was a part of our everyday rhythm.\n                Since I was a child, I’ve always loved creating things. I used durian shells to make crafts, drew mangosteens on the wall, and\n                freely created with whatever nature offered. My parents supported me in quiet, gentle ways. On holidays, they took my sister\n                and me to explore different parts of Thailand, which gave me a sense of curiosity and connection.\n                As the world grows more developed, I feel that simple living becomes harder to reach. But growing up that way taught me\n                how to rely on myself and stay close to nature. That way of life still lives in me — it’s something I try to carry forward.\n                Later, I studied Art Education at university. It was a joyful time — I enjoyed the freedom, met new friends, joined art activities,\n                and explored many forms of creativity. Most of my artworks were inspired by nature, and art has always stayed with me.\n                Then, about four years ago, I went hiking and reached the top of a mountain. That evening, the sky after the rain was\n                incredibly beautiful. I quickly painted the atmosphere using natural watercolor I had bought from an artist I admire. I don’t\n                know why, but that moment made me feel deeply connected — I even cried. It felt like I had reconnected with my childhood\n                self again — the joy and freedom of creating something simple, from the heart. I hadn’t felt that way in a very long time. Since\n                that day, nature has become the main inspiration and energy in my art.\n                Nature teaches me to be present, and to understand myself more. The more time I spend with it, the more I want to care for it\n                and learn from it.
